How many times will I change my portfolio until I'm set on a design? The world may never know!

This was my second attempt at a portfolio website, very much inspired by digital brutalism and my most creative portfolio design yet.
I ended up changing the design for a cleaner, more responsive design (see my current site: maeganmcbride.com), but I have a soft spot for this look.

I made this site using HTML5 and vanilla CSS. It was a bit of an experiment, but I find that I always learn the most working on passion projects.
